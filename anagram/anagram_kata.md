Write a program that generates all two-word anagrams of the string “documenting”. 
You must focus on the readability of your code, and you must not include any kind of documentations to it.
The goal is to create a code that everybody can read and understand easily.
Here’s a [word list](word_list.txt) you might want to use.

### test cases :)
