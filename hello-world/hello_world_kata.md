Plesae use TDD.
Mock objects should probably be used to stub out the user display.

This teaches the kata method in the simplest possible terms to ensure:
1. your PC has necessary software and could compile your code
2. you know how to set up/run tests for specified language\framework:
    - run tests from CLI (for CI/CD etc)
    - run tests from UI ( for green/red cycle)
3. Run your code without tests from CLI and UI.
